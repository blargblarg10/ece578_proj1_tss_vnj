Description:
    The CollisionDomain class acts as a registry of devices within a collision domain.
    It maintains a list of devices (stations and AP) and facilitates the broadcasting of events to all devices within the domain.

Responsibilities:
    - Maintains a list of devices within its range.
    - Broadcasts events to all registered devices.

Usage:
    - Devices register themselves with the collision domain.
    - When a device wants to send an event, it informs the collision domain.
    - The collision domain broadcasts the event to all registered devices.
    - Each device handles the event based on its logic and state.
