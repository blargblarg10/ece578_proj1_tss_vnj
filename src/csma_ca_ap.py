csma_ca_ap.py

Description:
    The csma_ca_ap module represents an access point (AP) in a CSMA/CA network.
    It handles events related to RTS reception, data reception, and collision detection.

Responsibilities:
    - Sends CTS frames in response to RTS frames from transmitting stations.
    - Sends ACK frames in response to data frames from transmitting stations.
    - Handles collisions and waits for the medium to become idle.

Usage:
    - The module reacts to various events to simulate the behavior of an AP in a CSMA/CA network.
