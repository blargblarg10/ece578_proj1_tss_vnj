csma_ca_tx.py

Description:
    The csma_ca_tx module represents a transmitting node in a CSMA/CA network.
    It handles events related to data arrival, RTS transmission, CTS acknowledgement, data transmission, ACK reception, collision, and backoff timer expiration.

Responsibilities:
    - Initiates the CSMA/CA process upon data arrival if the medium is idle.
    - Sends RTS frames and handles CTS acknowledgements.
    - Transmits data frames and handles ACK receptions.
    - Manages backoff timers and retries in case of collisions.

Usage:
    - The module reacts to various events to simulate the behavior of a transmitting station in a CSMA/CA network.
